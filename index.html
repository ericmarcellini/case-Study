        Dr. Marco Vietor and Paul Crusius have been creating successful businesses since college. Now they lead hear.com, the fastest growing hearing aid company in the world. This is their story.
    </p>
    <p>
        Let’s be honest, very few people want to wear hearing aids. Although there have been huge improvements in technology, most people don’t use them simply because they are still big and ugly. However, Dr. Marco Vietor and Paul Crusius wanted to change this perception with a revolutionary device developed by the top hearing aid engineers from Signia.
    </p>
    <p>    
        After many years of research and development, Signia’s (formerly Siemens) team of engineers came up with a game-changing hearing aid.
    </p>
    <p>    
        <b>The result:</b> A hearing device that packs the latest German technology in a design so small, it disappears completely inside the ear. It’s called the Silk Px by Signia.

        <h2 class="bannerText">Signia Silk is the most discreet hearing aid in the world.</h2>
    </div>
        
    
    <p> 
        <b>The High-Tech Hearing Aids of the Future:</b><br>   
         This Silk Px comes with smartphone connectivity, allowing you to control the device with your iPhone or Android.
    </p> 
    <p>   
        In addition, with this device you will notice remarkable improvements in your ability to clearly understand speech, even in noisy environments like a busy restaurant.
    </p>    
    <p>    
        Dr. Vietor expressed his satisfaction with the Signia engineers’ work: “We can now offer amazing speech clarity and smartphone connectivity in a virtually invisible design – and all that for a reasonable price!”
